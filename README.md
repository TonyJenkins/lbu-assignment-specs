# Computer Programming Assignments

These are the two project tasks for the *Programming Portfolio*. 

Your programs should be hosted in your GitHub repo, along with your weekly work.

For full details of the assessment refer to the specification on MyBeckett. For full marks you need to attempt both projects, but you do not have to complete everything. The specs in each folder set out what is required to pass, and provide suggestions for additional features.

**The versions here are correct and current.**
